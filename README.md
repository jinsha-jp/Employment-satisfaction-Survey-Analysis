## Description
This analysis seeks to understand the key factors that contribute to employee job satisfaction within the organization. The analysis will take into account various variables such as compensation, work-life balance, work environment, workload,etc.

## Objectives:
- Identify key factors that influence job satisfaction.
- Assess the overall job satisfaction levels of employees across different departments and demographics.
- Develop actionable insights and recommendations to improve job satisfaction and organizational culture.

## Data collection and Modelling
This dataset contains survey results from 3025 employees who provided feedback on various aspects of their job satisfaction within the organization. The Employee Satisfaction Survey Dataset has been successfully transformed and loaded into Microsoft Power BI Desktop for further data modeling, visualization, and analysis.

 ### Data Import and Cleansing in Power Query:
- The raw survey data was imported into Power BI, and Power Query was used to clean and format the dataset.
- Missing Values: Identified and handled missing values, either by removing incomplete rows or filling them based on business rules or averages.
- Data Type Conversion: Ensured that the data types for each column were appropriate (e.g., text for categorical data, numerical for ratings).
- Error Handling: Checked for any inconsistencies or errors in the data, such as invalid responses or outliers, and corrected them
### Data Transformation for Analysis:
- Calculated Columns: Created new calculated columns, if necessary, to aggregate or segment the data. For example, creating an overall satisfaction score by averaging key question ratings.
- Grouping and Binning: Grouped employees by demographics (age group
- The cleaned and transformed data was loaded into Power BI
### Data Modeling in Power BI:
 Established relationships between tables (e.g., linking demographic data with survey responses) to ensure that the data can be analyzed cohesively across different dimensions.

## Insights

1.	The average job satisfaction score across all 3025 employees is 3.4. This indicates a moderate level of overall satisfaction, as it is slightly above the neutral midpoint on a scale of 1 to 5.
  - The fact that 41% of employees gave a rating of  4 indicates that many employees are fairly content, but the 14% scoring a 1 suggests that there are significant areas of concern that need addressing to improve the satisfaction of the dissatisfied group.
2.	Dissatisfaction with Work-Life Balance:
  - 20% with a score of 1 and 18% with a score of 2 indicate that 38% of employees are dissatisfied with their work-life balance. This group represents a significant portion of the workforce and points to potential issues that need addressing.
  - 21% of employees rating their work-life balance as 4 and 22% rating it as 5 shows that a sizable portion of employees do enjoy a good work-life balance
  - 22% of employees rated their work-life balance as 5, suggesting that a good portion of employees are very satisfied and feel they maintain a healthy balance between work and personal life.
3.	Job satisfaction trends are similar across all job levels (e.g., entry-level, mid-level, senior-level), it suggests that employees at different levels of the organization are experiencing similar levels of satisfaction. This could indicate a cohesive organizational culture or consistent policies that impact all employees equally, regardless of their role or seniority.

4.	Similar job satisfaction trends across age groups suggest that there are no significant generational differences in how employees perceive their job satisfaction. This could indicate that the organization is effectively catering to the needs of a diverse workforce.

5.	Job satisfaction tends to improve when the workload is 2 or lower.

## Recommendation:
1.	Surveys or Interviews: Follow-up with employees who rated their satisfaction low (1 or 2) through interviews or focus groups to get a clearer picture of the issues they are facing.
2.	Flexible Work Arrangements: Explore options like flexible hours, remote work, or compressed workweeks to allow employees to manage their personal commitments alongside their professional responsibilities.
3.	Support for Mental Health and Well-being: Offering programs focused on mental health, stress management, and work-life integration could help employees struggling with their balance.
